# Scrape Hedgeye Webpage

This Notebook contains a script corresponding to the exercise evocated in this repo :  
https://github.com/fkchang/Data-Engineer-Applicant-Exercise  

The idea is to scrape this [website's main page's HTML](https://app.hedgeye.com/insights/all?type=insight), using **Beautifulsoup**. Then, we retrieve the top 6 trending articles from this page, and their corresponding URLs. Finally, we can scrape each of the corresponding webpages, using the URLs, in order to obtain all the data we need for each article.  

- Datetime Published
- Headline
- If an author exists (only first author):
  - Image Href
  - Name
  - Twitter Handle (leave blank if not present)
- Content Body HTML

This script has been written in **Python using Jupyter Notebook**.  
The webpages has been scraped using **Beautifulsoup**.  
The results have been stored into a **Pandas dataframe**.
